1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

I think this took me roughly 8-10 hours? My usual issue with QAP tends to be getting started, but once you get started things tend to go more smoothly

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

It was mainly the lectures, W3Schools, and I also have tried the coddy.tech bootcamp (normally use freecode camp but I could not find a Java course on there)

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

I did not ask anyone from the class for help, or any instructors.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

I did not.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

I feel relatively confident to figure out other questions of a similar difficulty, would likely spend again most of the time getting started.
